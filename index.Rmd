<!-- # About this publication {-} -->
<!-- The International Yearbook of Industrial Statistics published by UNIDO contains a wealth of information on the level, structure and growth of world manufacturing. Data are presented at the most detailed level of 155 manufacturing industries. While these data are used by researchers to carry out in-depth economic analyses of structural transformation, many users have requested more concise statistical information on overall growth trends and the structure of global manufacturing. -->
<!-- This publication serves as an addendum to the International Yearbook of Industrial Statistics 2021 and provides some important statistical information on global manufacturing. The publication is compiled from data published in the Yearbook and other data products of UNIDO Statistics. -->
<!-- The publication is compiled and disseminated by UNIDO Statistics. -->
